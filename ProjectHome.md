# Invade Spacers #
I wrote this game in high school when I was playing a lot of Phoenix on the TI-83 (in an attempt to clone it).  This was mostly uploaded for nostalgic purposes -- I was really limited with software when writing it (no internet access; only MS Paint and Sound Recorder with an earbud).  The code is really ugly but I honestly don't give a shit.

### Long Boring Description ###
This was a fun project that I had worked on in my same time while being a teacher's aide for my high school Visual Basic class.  Some of my classmates had even created "mods" that replaced the bitmaps with cooler ships or themes (Star Trek, Star Wars).

All of the game data for this game was originally created by me using what I had available to me my high school computer lab.  I was limited to a text editor, Microsoft Wav Editor, a pair of headphones (to be used backwards as audio input), MS Paint, and Python/PyGame (which I had "smuggled" into the computer lab).

This was one of my first endeavors with PyGame, and I coded this while I was still in my infancy as a programmer, so the code is not something to be admired.  However, this project was a really fun memory for me and I may go back and add some things if I ever get the itch.
